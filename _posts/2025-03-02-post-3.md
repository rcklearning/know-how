Using Power Pages Components like a PCF
======

Custom components are a brilliant way to add content and functionality to your page, but they don't have to work in isolation.
------

The power of Jquery and Liquid allows you to add a component to an existing field (or fields!), just like you would add a PCF when creating a model-driven app. In this blog I'll demonstrate how a custom component can be added to fields on your basic or multi-step forms.

Power Pages custom components are a well-documented feature, but the official documentation largely focuses on adding standalone components such as Card galleries. However, as demonstrated by Nick Doelman [here](https://readyxrm.blog/2025/03/20/power-pages-inserting-content-snippets-in-design-studio/) and the Power Pro Dev team [in their recent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4jAp0KU5pA), the parameters element of custom components allows virtually anything to be passed in - including field names. As power pages sites render form fields with a standard ID - the field's logical name - we can use Jquery to easily add functionality to an individual fields via our component - the field name parameter just determines which field to add it to!

To demonstrate this, let's walk through an example. We'll create a custom component that allows users to enter a number in the Length unit of their choice and then converts it on our form's field to ensure we're collecting data in a consistent unit - in our case Kilometres(Km) . Our component will be created independent of any field, but can easily be applied from the Design Studio as required just by passing in the logical name of the field.

Setting Up
-------

We have a Power Pages site for "Acorn Rescue" who specialise in emergency animal rescue. They have a basic form via which users can enter details of an animal require emergency rescue. On this form, users are asked to enter the size of the animal if known. As we know, Dataverse fields can be set to accept integers but not a specific unit. To ensure there's some consistency in how this is stored, the team maintaining the site added a label specifying centimetres, but this created confusion: it wasn't 100% clear if a value submitted was in centimetres as some didn't seem accurate - had users converted it properly? Had they entered it as another unit assuming it would be converted once submitted? 

So, a new component was needed to allow users to select their preferred unit, enter their value and have this converted to centimetres for submission on the existing field. Now you may be thinking - okay, let's add this via code to the basic form record, the webpage maybe, or let's create a PCF and do it that way? Sure, we could, but let's see if we can create something the main team can add via the Design Studio. Challenge accepted!

Building Our Component
-------

First, let's create our component in a new Web Template. We'll start with the functional part, applied to a specific form field, rather than the manifest. This way, we can demonstrate our component works as expected before making it dynamic via our Liquid parameters.

Here's our basic HTML for our custom input field, passed to JS variables in our script tag to allow us to insert them as required shortly:

```

<input
  type="number"
  id="userValue"
  name="user Value"
  required
  minlength="1"
  maxlength="10000000"
  />

```
And our unit selector:

```

<label for="unitSelect">Choose a unit:</label>
  <select name="unit" id="unitSelect">
  <option value="centimetre">Centimetres</option>
  <option value="metre">Metres</option>
  <option value="feet">Feet</option>
  <option value="inch">Inches</option>
</select>

```

In its current format, adding this component would just append these two inputs to the end of our form. However, we want to add these to our specific 'Length' field. Let's add some JS with Jquery to append the HTML so they appear below the form field label before the actual field:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
var userInput = `<input
  type="number"
  id="userValue"
  name="user Value"
  required
  minlength="1"
  maxlength="10000000"
  />`

var unitSelect = `<label for="unitSelect">Choose a unit:</label>
  <select name="unit" id="unitSelect">
  <option value="kilometre">Kilometres</option>
  <option value="centimetre">Centimetres</option>
  <option value="metre">Metres</option>
  <option value="mile">Miles</option>
  <option value="yard">Yards</option>
  <option value="feet">Feet</option>
  <option value="inch">Inches</option>
</select>`

$("#length_label").append(unitSelect);
$("#length_label").append(userInput);

</script>

```

And then we'll add the functions which converts the input to Centimetres and ensure this runs on change of either input field:

```
$("#userValue").on("change", convertFunction);
$("#unitSelect").on("change", convertFunction);

function convertFunction(){
    console.log("triggered!")
    let value = $("#userValue").val();
    let unit = $("#unitSelect").val();
    convert(unit, value);
}

function convert(unit, value){
   switch(unit) {
  case "metre":
     $("#new_length").val(value/1000);
    break;
  case "mile":
     $("#new_length").val(value*1.609);
    break;
  case "yard":
     $("#new_length").val(value/1094);
    break;
  case "feet":
     $("#new_length").val(value/3281);
    break;
  case "inch":
     $("#new_length").val(value/39370);
    break;
  default:
     $("#new_length").val(value);
}
}


```

So far, so Content Snippet
-------

Our component works but a) It's bound to a specific field and b) It cannot be added via the Design Studio. In it's current guise, we could probably just create this as a content snippet and it where needed (perhaps using this method to make it less onerous: (https://readyxrm.blog/2025/03/20/power-pages-inserting-content-snippets-in-design-studio/)). However, this is where our Manifest and Liquid's server-side rendering can take things even further!

Let's add our Manifest with one parameter - field name:

```
{% raw %}

{% manifest %} 
    { 
    "type": "Functional", 
    "displayName": "Unit Converter", 
    "description": "This component allows the user to convert a dataverse number field from a default unit into any related unit", 
    "params": [ 
        { 
        "id": "fieldLogicalName", 
        "displayName": "Field", 
        "description": "Enter the field logical name you would like to add this component to" 
        }, 
        ] 
    } 
{% endmanifest %} 

{% endraw %}

```
We can then use this Liquid variable in our existing JS in place of the hard-coded field name. To make it easier for others to add via the Design Studio, we'll only ask for the logical name and let our component handle the formatting. Here's our updated JS/Liquid for this part:

```
var field = "{{ fieldLogicalName | escape }}"

$("#" + field + "_label").append(compHtml);
$("#" + field + "_label").append(userInput);
$("#userValue").on("change", convertFunction);
$("#unitSelect").on("change", convertFunction);

```

Now, we can add this component via Design Studio, pass in the field's logical name and voila - our component can be added to any form providing the field logical name matches to one on the form:

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images//images/conversion-component.png)


But wait - there's more! Our component only works for Length, but the problem I described earlier about unit consistency could work for any unit of measure. So, let's make our component useful for any numeric field and allow our colleagues to set the unit in Design Studio. Here's our full code for a component that allows for two parameters - the field you want to apply it to and the Unit we're working with:

{% raw %}
```
{% manifest %} 
    { 
    "type": "Functional", 
    "displayName": "Unit Converter", 
    "description": "This component allows the user to convert a dataverse number field from a default unit into any related unit", 
    "params": [ 
        { 
        "id": "fieldLogicalName", 
        "displayName": "Field", 
        "description": "Enter the field logical name you would like to add this component to" 
        }, 
        { 
        "id": "defaultUnit", 
        "displayName": "Default Unit", 
        "description": "Enter the unit type - either 'Length' or 'Mass'. This will also determine the conversion options and the default - Kg for Mass, Km for Length" 
        }] 
    } 
{% endmanifest %} 

<script type="text/javascript">
var userInput = `<input
  type="number"
  id="userValue"
  name="user Value"
  required
  minlength="1"
  maxlength="10000000"
  />`
{% if defaultUnit == "Length" %}
   var compHtml = `<label for="unit-select">Choose a unit:</label>
  <select name="unit" id="unit-select">
  <option value="kilometre">Kilometres</option>
  <option value="centimetre">Centimetres</option>
  <option value="metre">Metres</option>
  <option value="mile">Miles</option>
  <option value="yard">Yards</option>
  <option value="feet">Feet</option>
  <option value="inch">Inches</option>
</select>`
{% elsif defaultUnit == "Mass" %}
 var unitSelect = `<label for="unitSelect">Choose a unit:</label>
  <select name="unit" id="unitSelect">
  <option value="kilogram">Kilos</option>
  <option value="gram">Grams</option>
  <option value="ounce">Ounces</option>
  <option value="pound">Pounds</option>
  <option value="stone">Stones</option>
</select>`

{% endif %}

   var field = "{{ fieldLogicalName | escape }}"
   $("#" + field + "_label").append(unitSelect);
   $("#" + field + "_label").append(userInput);
   $("#userValue").on("change", convertFunction);
   $("#unit-select").on("change", convertFunction);

function convertFunction(){
    let value = $("#userValue").val();
    let unit = $("#unit-select").val();
    convert(unit, value);
}

function convert(unit, value){
   switch(unit) {
  case "Centimetre":
    $("#" + field).val(value/100000);
    break;
  case "metre":
    $("#" + field).val(value/1000);
    break;
  case "mile":
    $("#" + field).val(value*1.609);
    break;
  case "yard":
    $("#" + field).val(value/1094);
    break;
  case "feet":
    $("#" + field).val(value/3281);
    break;
  case "inch":
    $("#" + field).val(value/39370);
    break;
  default:
    $("#" + field).val(value);
}
}
   

</script>

```
{% endraw %}

In summary, the existing power of Liquid and JQuery combined with Custom Component parameters allows devs to create re-usable field-based components that others can easily apply via the Design Studio. Until we have parameter types beyond strings then adding proper PCFs to the base Dataverse form is stil a more robust solution, but where teams may not have the pro-Dev capability or tooling to create PCFs, I hope this post shows that there is an alternative approach available.

Thanks for reading! In the spirit of community, the code for this component is available here for someone else to work their magic on :)
