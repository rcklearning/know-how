Welcome to "Know-How": A Power Pages blog
======

I am a senior Power Platform developer who lives and breathes the product. This is my new blog to showcase my ideas, solutions and my portfolio of work.

About Me
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

What to Expect
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

New Series: Power Platform Pauses!
------

For those new to the Power Platform ecosystem, once you have navigated the dizzying array of documents, guidance and community resources, you can quickly find yourself on the cusp of releasing your first app (and your sense of pride growing exponentially!). Perhaps you're a product owner who has found steering a project to production far less taxing than you had envisaged. This is the beauty of the ecosystem after all. 

However, this is the perfect time to take a breath, take a minute, pause! Because, there are some critical points during the design and development stage when, in my view at least, it's critical to understand the hidden bumps in the road ahead and the risks of committing to a particular path. Whether its Dataverse field configuration which might hinder some future changes or a design which has long-term limitations, this series is intended to help your future self.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
