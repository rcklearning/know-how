New Series Ahead: Power Platform Pauses!
------

For those new to the Power Platform ecosystem, once you have navigated the dizzying array of documents, guidance and community resources, you can quickly find yourself on the cusp of releasing your first app (and your sense of pride growing exponentially!). Perhaps you're a product owner who has found steering a project to production far less taxing than you had envisaged. This is the beauty of the ecosystem after all. 

However, this is the perfect time to take a breath, take a minute, pause! Because, there are some critical points during the design and development stage when, in my view at least, it's critical to understand the hidden bumps in the road ahead and the risks of committing to a particular path. Whether its Dataverse field configuration which might hinder some future changes or a design which has long-term limitations, this series is intended to help your future self.

This site is built on GitHub Pages w/Jekyll using a brilliant template called 'Academic Pages' - https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io. The great thing about this approach is it uses Liquid behind the scenes so has been a great way to use and test skills which can be applied directly in Power Pages.
